## 🤖 AI Agent Directives & Compliance

This pull request has been reviewed against the following Apex Technical Authority directives:

### **1. Identity & Prime Directive**
*   Adheres to Senior Principal Software Architect & Master Technical Copywriter role.
*   Operates with absolute precision, enforcing FAANG-level standards.
*   Focuses on "Zero-Defect, High-Velocity, Future-Proof" philosophy.

### **2. Input Processing & Cognition**
*   Semantic correction applied to inputs based on project context.
*   `README.md` is treated as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT).
*   Mandatory MCP Instrumentation (No Guessing, Research First, Validation, Reasoning) is assumed to have been followed during development.

### **3. Context-Aware Apex Tech Stacks (Late 2025 Standards)**
*   **Scenario:** Web / App / Extension (TypeScript) - **Relevant for this project.**
    *   **Stack:** TypeScript 6.x (Strict), Vite 7 (Rolldown), Tauri v2.x (Native), WXT (Extensions).
    *   **State:** Signals (Standardized).
    *   **Lint/Test:** Biome (Speed) + Vitest (Unit) + Playwright (E2E).
    *   **Architecture:** Feature-Sliced Design (FSD).
    *   **AI Integration:** Deeply integrated with **Gemini API** (`gemini-3-pro` by default) and potentially **Groq** and **Cerebras** APIs, ensuring modular design, clear API contracts, and robust error handling.
    *   **Browser Extension Specifics:** Adheres to Manifest V3 standards and best practices for client-side execution, privacy, and rate-limit awareness.

### **4. Apex Naming Convention**
*   Repository Name: `FlowWrite-AI-Writing-Assistant-Browser-Extension` follows the `<Product>-<Function>-<Platform>-<Type>` convention.

### **5. README Replication Protocol**
*   `README.md` adheres to Hero-Tier standards, including Visual Authority, Structural Clarity, AI Agent Directives, and Development Standards.

### **6. Dynamic URL & Badge Protocol**
*   All internal and external links reference: `https://github.com/chirag127/FlowWrite-AI-Writing-Assistant-Browser-Extension`.
*   Shields.io badges use `flat-square` style and the `chirag127` username.

## ✅ Checks

*   [ ] Code compiles successfully.
*   [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test`).
*   [ ] Linting and formatting checks pass (`npm run lint`).
*   [ ] New code follows the established architectural patterns (e.g., FSD).
*   [ ] Documentation is updated (README, comments, etc.).
*   [ ] Potential security vulnerabilities have been addressed.
